# autonomous-dev — the platform

This repo is the **platform** in the autonomous-maintenance experiment: the **control
plane** (scheduler) plus the **dev-agent** image it runs. The dev agent maintains a
*product* repo (initially the sibling Discord bot) by working like an engineer — branch,
code, test, open a PR — through GitHub.

## Engine

[`claude-agent-sdk`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python) — Claude
Code as an embeddable Python library (agent loop, tool suite, layered permission model,
sandbox mode, sessions/resume, `max_budget_usd`). We build on these primitives rather
than reinvent them. Requires the `claude` CLI on PATH.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync                      # create the venv, install deps
cp .env.example .env         # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or run `claude login`
```

## Run (current PoC)

```bash
uv run autonomous-dev "Summarize the repo layout" --repo ../discord-bot
```

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest                # structural tests, no network
```

## Conventions

- Python 3.12, `uv` for env/deps, type hints throughout.
- `async` core with a thin sync wrapper for the CLI.
- Keep the seam to the SDK in one place; layer guardrails as composable hooks.
